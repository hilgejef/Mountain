# Mountain

Mountain is a Fountain parser and HTML converter written in Python.
To use Mountain, invoke the script with either:

1. Input and output file
2. Input file, output file, and optional CSS file

The CSS file will be included into the HTML output.

Possible TODO: Add a default CSS file (possibly for converting immediately into PDF?)
